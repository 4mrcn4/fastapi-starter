## FastAPI-Starter

A FastAPI based starter that relies heavily on existing plugins to create an almost no-code experience. The goal is to build a template that can be used as a starting point for any FastAPI based project and go from 0 to 100 within seconds. ðŸ™‚ ðŸš€

### Packages used

* [FastAPI Users](https://github.com/fastapi-users/fastapi-users) - Provides user registration, models, authentication etc.
* [React-Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) - Almost zero-effort admin interface using discovered interfaces
* [FastAPI CRUD Router](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter) - [WIP] No need to rewrite generic CRUD routes

And for cases where react-admin is not enough:

* [OpenAPI-Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) - Creates Typescript API directly using FastAPI OpenAPI spec, no need to write implementations to interact with backend.
